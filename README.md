# ACTL4305-final-assignment

In this assessment task, I build models to predict pure premiums for car insurance using various data such as calendar year, time exposure to risk, vehicle age and type, prior claims, etc. Definition of pure premium is provided in the task description.

I approached this task by building model to predict claims frequency and claim severity separately then use that result to calculate the pure premium (pure premium= frequency*severity).

The main modeling technique used is generalized linear models (GLM) 

R code and task description, report and rmarkdown file to generate the report is provided alongside the dataset.
